# Architectural Kata

## Solution overview

In our solution we focused mostly on resolving the elasticity problem of the system, which was causing problem tickets to be lost or wrongly assigned. We also tackled the rigidity of the overall system, with regard to change, which made fixing existing and emerging bugs unfeasible.
Our overall approach is explained in the [SystemOverview](Doc/Adr/SystemOverview.md) ADR.

## Documenting
To document our solution we employed the C4 Architectural documentation model. We used [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) and the [C4 Plant UML stdlib](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML) to prepare the diagrams.
