# Title
General Ticket System Architecture

## Status
Approved

## Context
We need an elastic system, that can respond to Customer access spikes. 
We need a highly testable system  to ensure robustness and quick response to change.

## Decision
We decided to implement the Ticket System using Micrservice Architecture. This architecture offers high elasticity and fault tolerance and
we will be able to implement changes to the system at a high rate thanks to its high testability. 
Ticketing need not be highly performant but rather reliable, so we can get away with the performance issues of a Micrservice architecture.
Finally we already have a good CI/CD infrastructure which we can leverage to support this transition.
